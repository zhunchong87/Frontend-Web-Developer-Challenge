## The Challenge 

### What You'll need to build

You'll need to develop a frontend interface for a food logging webapp where a user can search for food information in our database and log their meal. The user should also be able to review their past logged meals.

### Bits and Pieces to take note of
* Use `http://test.holmusk.com/food/search?q=food_search_query`, where the *food_search_query* parameter should be replaced by a food name, to search for food items
* Store meal information locally.
* You will need to implement **autocomplete with a search view** [With a maximum of 10 results so that the interface does not look cluttered] so that users are able to easily enter food items they have had. 
* With that said we wish you good luck and look forward to receiving your submission!

## Judging Criteria
* What you have produced will determine your final outcome
* Responsive and creative design, appropriateness of error messages, etc
* Because we love people who have a passion for expanding their horizons, your background with frontend libraries do not matter so much provided you are able to demonstrate your learning ability!

### Bonus Points
* Use of Angular.js or React.js is a plus
